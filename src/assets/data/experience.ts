    description: `During internship, I gained hands-on experience with Next.js and GraphQL development. 
    Notably, I worked on a project CRUD Operation App,
    focusing on enterprise-level large data. Using MongoDB for efficient data storage and ag-Grid for advanced 
    front-end data rendering, I implemented server-side rendering to optimize performance and provide a seamless 
    user experience. 
    Additionally,I included Map enabling users to search for and save locations, 
    while enhancing the interface with features like tooltips and easy navigation. 
    Overall, my internship allowed me to deliver high-quality solutions for data rendering, web development, 
    and API design using Next.js and GraphQL.
